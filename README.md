ADELTA sis the Australian Directory of Electronic Literature and Text-based Art

The directory emerges from the Creative Nation ARC discovery funded project: Writers and Writing in the New Media Arts led by 
Assoc/Prof Anna Gibbs and Dr Maria Angel from the Writing and Society Research Group in the School of Humanities 
and Communication Arts at the University of Western Sydney.

This project is building and/or adapting open source software to house an interactive directory of Australian writing in the New Media Arts.

This work is taking place in the context of work on the Consortium of Electronic Literature (CELL) an international consortium with 
partners. This consortium addresses collaboration and the interoperability of different 
international databases of electronic literature. 


Techincal work on this project is being done by the [UWS eResearch team](http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/projects/digital-humanities/), led by Peter Sefton, with technical
